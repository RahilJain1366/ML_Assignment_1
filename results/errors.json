Will stop by here for bun bo hue if we're in the area but won't go out of our way to come here anymore. They only take cash. Mom and pop shop and all its attachment."

Situated in a strip mall (it's N Scottsdale, is there anything else?) this location's patio is much bigger than the original, but the views suck. My main beef with this location was the unbelievable wait. We got there at 6:30 pm, and yes we had a large party. But at 9 PM, I left. I left without eating. It's new and all the N Scottsdale peole are flocking there obviously, but the 2 1/2 hour wait was insane. I'll stick with my location."

My friends and I walked over to PF Changs from MGM Grand - Very walkable distance and great spot on The Strip. We had to wait for 20 minutes for our table, but we were given one of those vibrating, light-flashing coasters to let us know when our table was ready, so we went outside to wait and people watch until our table was ready. Awesome dry desert heat, interesting people, and view. We got a great booth and the service was awesome. I asked if I could apply both gift cards to our total bill and he said of course I could. Win! :) The meals were reasonably priced and took about 15-20 minutes to get to our table. We all ordered something different and I was hankering for some noodles. Not sure what I ordered but I think it was deep friend noodles that were then stir fried. What was I thinking...Anyway, the sauce was thick and the meal sat heavy in my tummy. The food wasn't super duper in my book, but then I've only had one dish there so far. Nothing super spectacular about the food that we ordered but we loved the restaurant, location, and service. You can't beat that! Oops, wait. My friend ordered a shrimp dish that was actually fresh and delicious looking. I will definitely go to PF Changs again to give it another try and we have one here in Seattle. Next time I will try something less fried. It's definitely worth checking out if you are in Vegas for the experience, price, and decent menu. I did love the iced tea, though. Very refreshing. :)"

        "text": "So here's the thing: after 4 times here the service has been consistently friendly but incompetent. For example, today I got sat in a nearly empty restaurant, and the host forgot to bring a menu. She said she'd bring one right back, and then forgot (I watched her stand at the host stand, bored). Took 5 minutes to get one from waiter. This is the kind of thing you'd forgive as a fluke, but you watch and see table-waiting basics being flubbed all over the place. Last time, I watched *three* different customers standing up and approach a waiter stand asking to find their waiter. My service was slow, and didn't anticipate common needs (like a coffee refill at breakfast). My food came out partially cold and partially hot, which is either a kitchen timing issue or a tardy waiter who left food sitting in the window too long. Seeing as it doesn't seem to be one bad server, I'd guess this the result of poor training--which is usually a management issue. If you can survive the service, the hip/classy atmosphere has rich dark wood, orange lighting, and attractive window bays looking at Memorial Stadium on the south tip of campus. The menu items I've had have been either decent or great. Worth a try, I suppose, but bring patience."

One of the things I love about Amaranth is how helpful their employees are. If you are new to healthy eating, have recently been diagnosed with an allergy, or need information about natural health supplements, Amaranth should be your first stop. The staff are genuinely friendly and knowledgeable. Another great thing about Amaranth is the points program: you collect points based on how much you spend and whether you bring your own bags; at 5,001 points you get a $10 gift certificate. Oh, and I almost forgot that they're very involved in the community and do lots of great community programming and outreach. Things that I buy frequently at Amaranth include organic fresh herbs, bulk products (dried beans and lentils, rice, granola, etc.), specialty oils and vinegars, and natural beauty products. My only complaint about Amaranth are the prices. Although they sometimes have good sales and you can buy some products by the case (like soy milk), prices are significantly higher than at Community Natural Foods (downtown or Chinook). The prices may be worth the convenience and the staff knowledge for some people, but for me it's sometimes hard to swallow."

Regular Filet Mignon on the other hand was overcooked and dry with no pink. Lobster Mac & Cheese felt overload with the Velveeta-ish cheese and no trace of lobster. Enjoyed the medley of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms much more. Signature Sea Bass with Truffle Butter Crust, Shitake Mushrooms, and Asparagus was a very nice light meal, cooked perfectly.

Another disclaimer: I greatly prefer Downtown to the Strip, and have tried to seek out fun spots to enjoy, so distance from the Strip isn't an issue. They have upgraded/renovated the FSE-facing rooms. Two visits ago they gave me one at no charge, wanted an upcharge the next time. I'm back in a month, for $19/night. My rooms have always been clean and smoke free. The heater/aircon units have sometimes been noisy. I don't hear much noise between rooms. The rooftop pool can be a very relaxing low key place to kick back. No worries if you bring your own drinks up if you do it without flaunting it. I don't think i've ever eaten there, but always start the day with coffee from the stand, where you get a free refill with the receipt. I always park in the outdoor parking lot just on the other side of the bus station. For dining, i try to hit: the weekend champagne next door at the Main St Station; the pizza at the Old Chicago Brewery in the Four Queens; the 1.25 beers at the newly renovated Gold Spike; the absolutely delicious Kabab Korner just across LVB on Fremont; breakfast at Binion's; prime rib at Magnolia's at the 4 Queens; and looking forward to checking out Hugo's Celler there next month. Fun activities include: taking in a baseball game [minor league 51's] at Cashman Field, a 15 minute walk; taking the double decker bus up the Strip [by catching it at the main bus station on Stewart]; enjoying some really cheap Crown drinks at the Dome in the Plaza... Summary: not for everybody, or for those expecting strip like amenities. The Golden Nugget is the downtown sport for that. But, a decent place for those on a budget who don't mind exploring a bit..."

Of course, you must first play Parking Roulette before you can walk anywhere along Smallman Street, but I lucked out with an inexpensive metered spot. Did I mention the shop is almost as little as the donuts themselves? Oh yeah. You have enough room to walk in, order and walk out, so there's definitely no eating in here. But no biggie. I was impressed with their variety of options and decided to try their popular Maple Bacon and vanilla frosted with sprinkles. After paying the friendly cashier, I took them on my way to a nearby cafe to enjoy with my morning mocha. After eating one of each, I can honestly say I was a little let down. They were okay for cake donuts, but I've had better (and bigger) ones for around the same price. I think I was more suprised than anything since they're made fresh right there behind the counter. PL&LD might be worth a one-time stop to try in you're in the area, but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come back again."

        "text": "I am not quite sure how I feel about Auberge du Vieux Port. On one hand, it is located in a prime location- in the middle of Old Montreal and walking distance to the metro and several attractions. On the other hand, everything else.. The location is the major seller of this hotel, being in the middle of the most popular neighborhoods for tourists. But if you are driving, be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for their valet parking. The fee when we visited in Oct 2017 was $35CAD per night with in/out privileges. However, due to the space issue in the area their lot is not directly on site, so you have to call the front desk 15 minutes in advance to when you actually need you car. We ended up parking at a nearby lot for $18CAD/night. We checked in on a Friday and the front desk attendant was friendly enough, she informed us that our room was in a different building and a valet would come to help us with our bags. We weren't sure what this meant so we just went with it. We were sent 2 blocks away into a tiny building with a restaurant and bar directly underneath us. This should have been a red flag, but we were too tired and confused. We didn't realize that most of the rooms would not be in the main building. And that there would be no elevator. Our room was small and dated, but had a rustic feel to it with the exposed walls, wooden floors, and oversized windows. The view was obstructed by the building across the street, but we didn't really care too much. The room was clean enough, and came stocked with a full kitchen which was nice. It all seemed fine until nighttime came. The beds here are extremely soft, something I am not used to, but I'm sure many others would love. The restaurant and bar downstairs was listed to close at 11, and the from desk even confirmed it. But for some reason, the music(and extremely heavy bass) was still going very loudly until past 1am. Even with our windows and curtains tightly shut, we could hear the restaurant's customer on the street being loud. We couldn't say for sure if they were drunk, but either way they were painfully loud. The bf is not by any means a light sleeper, and even he lost sleep. We ended up not being able to get up as early as we had planned because we were both just too tired. The next night was Saturday and by 9pm the noise got significantly louder. We wanted to go to bed but even if we had purchased earplugs, the thumping of the bass was enough to disturb us. We called the front desk, and they offered to move us. After about 40 minutes, we were moved to another building about 3 blocks away. They tried to explain that noise is a common issue in the neighborhood, but I don't think it is since our new room was nice and quiet for the rest of our stay (and on a Saturday night). Additinally, I don't know if our complaining had anything to do with the fact that when we called in for a razor, they came back 20m later to say that they were out of razors and didn't offer me any alternative solutions (like, where can I go buy one, will they have more the day after, etc.??). While I greatly appreciate their moving us to a different room without much hassle, I also really don't understand how they can operate their business this way. The entire first building we stayed must be a nightmare to stay in at night. Also, when I asked, the front desk assured me that the resraurant/bar closed at 11pm- but they had their music and custormers outside well past 1am! If you're going to try to cover that up, at least try harder. She sounded confused as to why I would complain, and I had to justify it by saying that we slept early since we like getting an early start. Overall, I really don't think we would stay here again or recommend it to our friends. If you like to party late into the weekends, this probably wouldn't bother you as much. But either way, it would've been really helpful to know beforehand."

Nice to have a reservation. They were slammed! There was a party with something like 20 people in the middle of the dinning room having a good old time. It was a birthday party, and the staff took time to bring out a cake and sing happy birthday and everything. Very sweet. After being seated, it took just minutes for us to get water and to put in our orders for wine. The wine arrived quickly thereafter and we were able to order our food. From there, the service was so, so slow. And not only did the server forget my glass of wine, but also my appetizer. She apologized multiple times, saying that she was quite busy at the moment, but would try and do a better job getting back to us. Besides the service snags, and our weird table in the back (rectangular tables should never be shoved into acute-shaped corners), it was a lovely dining experience. I went with the egg rolls and the pad Thai. The egg rolls were slightly overcooked, but had a nice flavor and delicious filling. The pad Thai -- and I never, ever order pad Thai -- was perfectly seasoned with a heaping offering! I could not finish the offering.

        "text": "Well, we were downtown last weekend and happened to be hungry at an odd hour due to a very late breakfast that morning and so immediately I thought \"Hey, lets go to Pizzeria Bianco. They can't possibly have a wait for a table at 2:30 pm on a Friday.\" Well, turns out they did but fortunately we only had to stand out in the 100 degree sunshine for 15 minutes or so. We've actually attempted to eat here a few other times over the years but when the wait time was quoted as 2 - 3 hours we moved on to dine somewhere else. So, was this pizza worth the wait you ask? Yes, it was absolutely worth a 15 minute wait. But no meal is worth a 3 hour wait. I think it's really silly that they don't serve pizza out on the patio or next door in the wine bar or just take reservations... its sort of a power play that they make people wait around for so long like that. I just don't get it. Anyway, I was surprised that the menu didn't have a whole lot of options. I really felt like a red sauce so that cut our choices down to three pizzas. I opted for the Margherita since that is a nice classic but of course hubby wanted some kind of meat so we added sausage. That was a very good decision since the sausage was absolutely delicious. We both loved the pizza and it was just the right amount of food for the two of us. Hubby didn't feel like it was worth the $18 but that is about what you would pay at other non-chain artisan pizza places that offer that neapolitan style pizza so I was fine with it. Our service was ok though a bit rushed. By the time we were done eating there were a few empty tables so I didn't really see why it was necessary to take our plates away immediately after my last bite (seriously, I was still chewing) and then bring the check immediately afterwards without asking if we wanted anything else. I guess that is just how they do things there. I'm glad I went since it is such a Phoenix landmark but I don't really see any reason to return."

There was a 20-minute wait and I am very happy they can take down your name and text you when the table was ready instead of having to wait inside the restaurant. We came back at the 15-minute mark and our table was ready and was seated promptly. We ordered the the fried calamari, warm steak salad, chicken burger, and a red sangria. Red sangria - very nicely presented, flavour was excellent. I don't usually drink alcohol but the sangria was done very well, strong but fruity, not watered down at all. I would definitely recommend! Fried calamari - flavour was great, the spicy jalape\u00f1os was a great addition. However, we found the texture of the calamari to be too soft and almost rubbery. It seems as though the calamari was pre-cooked, and the batter was added on later on. By the time we were half way done the dish the batter has soften and the dishes was not so pleasant. I would skip this one. The bed of salad underneath was very fresh though. Warm Steak Salad - I wish the salad base was more than just spinach, perhaps a mix of salad green with some hearty veggies (Kale, sweet potato, charred broccoli etc.) would be a good addition. The steak was cook very well and flavourful. A good dinner salad but I was not overly impressed. Chicken burger - the burger was good but we found the portion size to be on the small size for the price. Service was excellent overall. The staff was friendly, attentive, warm without being overbearing, a combination which is not easy to come by these days. However, I am disappointed with the quality/quantity and ambience of my experience."

I was very impressed with their professionalism when they came out to give me a quote. The gentleman walked the property while I was at work and was available to me when I called to answer all my questions. Their price was higher than others but I was impressed and sold by their promptness and friendliness. We've been using them for about 3 monthes now and they've always showed up the day they are supposed to. The quality of the work is very good and billing is easy with their auto pay service. On the negative side, I've become a bit defensive with them because it's starting to feel like I'm a money tree for them. \"Oh, you have a leak in your irrigation. That will cost 80$ to fix.\" \"Fine\", I say. The week after there's another leak and a story of how I really should replace my entire system because it's so old. This upsets me because I just paid 80 bucks to fix something that according to them wasn't worth fixing and I should have replaced in the first place. They have also mentioned that my tree in the front yard, that was just trimmed and maintained by an arborist, really needs some work and quoted me $600 (Inc discount) for a job I paid the arborist full price of 400$ to do. The tree looks great and doesn't need work. I really feel like I'm just another sale to them and that they're really just looking to line their pockets. I also understand that they're a business and their whole point is to make money but it rubs me the wrong way. I should also mention that recently sent out an email offering a $25 discount if you give them a 5 star yelp review. Obviously I'm forgoing that to try and give honest feedback. Seems to defeat the purpose of a rating website if companies can just buy 5 star reviews. So to recap: Great, friendly people. Slightly pricy Work is competed on time and satisfactorily Questionable selling practices. Good luck!"

That first visit the pizza was delicious, perfect crust on the bottom etc. they deliver to our house, so we ordered again. Pizza was a world apart from what it was the first time. No sauce, toppings randomly placed, crust was soggy. It was disappointing. We also ordered the honey bites, 75% of them were hard as rocks and the product as a whole was just meh. We called and they said the owner would call us. Sent him the info/pictures and let him know we weren't trying to get anything out of it, even though we paid for something we clearly didn't get. Yesterday we decided to give them another shot. We didn't even bother calling the store again, because sadly we feel like nothing will be done about it. The pizza was almost sauce less again. (We got the white pizza with chicken, mushrooms and bacon.) We thought that maybe it would be better. Now we don't like a ton of sauce like some places do, but you've gotta have some on it! The delivery guy came and didn't bring change with him. We're not the type to not tip, but this guy pretty much shot himself in the foot with that. We went to the car and dug out some quarters so he wouldn't leave empty handed. Now I will say that we added mushrooms to this order to meet the $15 minimum, and those were pretty tasty. However, when we ordered we asked for extra ranch and that didn't show up. The delivery guy said he would come back and unsurprisingly he didn't. I'd really love to give these guys a glowing review, but I just can't after paying for things I'm just not getting. If you're going to stop in and eat, I'd say hands down do it. But if you're going to get delivery be wary. The drivers don't seem to really care about anything except getting their tips. It's sad for me because the owner we chatted with, Dennis I believe was his name, is wonderful. He's got a great idea and now just needs the right people to help him out."

        "text": "I'm trusting the cashier's word that the chocolate bar/eclair was made without \"glaze.\" (As in powdered sugar glaze.) This is the first time in YEARS (at least a decade) that I've bitten into a chocolate-glazed donut/pastry, and it was delicious! Loved the texture! Couldn't handle more than four bites, though, as the flavor of the grease quickly overwhelmed me- not used to eating donuts anymore, you see, but overall, the eclair was light and fluffy, and the icing tasted just like the chocolate glazes I remember. The Cinnamon-sugar twist was also light and clean-tasting... Until I had enough of the grease flavor, of course. Compared to the grease flavor of other donut shops, Dutch Donut's not bad at all. Developed a rash on one of my arms a few minutes after the few bites I had of both pastries- could be a sign of cornstarch in powdered sugar glaze (which the cashier told me neither sugar donut nor eclair had), or perhaps these items were fried in corn oil...? Or perhaps powdered sugar in the air that I inhaled while inside the shop... It's happened to me before, at a Sprinkles, and I have a witness! Besides donuts, cruellers, donut holes, and eclairs, DDF also sells plain croissants and croissant sandwiches (ham & cheese and cheese-jalapeno). I decided not to push my luck asking the Asian cashier in her 40s/50s more questions, as her body language suggested annoyance, so I didn't even try any of the iced and frozen beverages, such as teas,coffees, smoothies, and \"bubble\" drinks. I will ask for more info if someone else is behind the counter on my next visit. Posters mentioned Tea Zone brand teas and Dragonfly-brand mixes are used here."

When we got in it was pretty busy and there was a short 5-10 minute wait for our table. There was coffee and water in the waiting area which was a nice surprise. We were greeted promptly by our server who was super friendly and energetic. I settled on a breakfast burrito. When it came out I was overwhelmed by the size of it. As I dug in I quickly realized it was a classic example of quantity over quality. The burrito was covered with salsa which made it soggy on the bottom. I found that the egg whites inside were a little bland and needed salt. The burrito was filled with egg whites, green peppers, and black olives. Service fell off towards the end with our drinks running empty. The food was just OK. Maybe it was just what I ordered?"

Cons: shockingly unfriendly staff Even though there was only one major con, I still only rate this restaurant a 3-star, because of the service. I went there for my 21st birthday with my boyfriend and was loving the atmosphere and the food, but extremely disappointed at the staff, especially for paying so much money! Our waiter did not check our ID's when we ordered wine, and as I said it was only my 21st birthday and I look like I am 16 years old. There was hardly a smile from both the staff who seated us and our server. The only friendly staff members were the buss boys! I tried to chalk it up to being a Friday night, but out server's behavior over the dessert menu was appalling. My boyfriend wanted to order me some dessert to celebrate my birthday, but I was insisting I was too full for it (especially for another $20 on a slice of cake). My boyfriend still tried to let my server know that it was a special occasion for us and our server responded with \"We would have been able to do something, but you declined to order dessert\" loud enough for me to hear. Upon seeing the disgusted look on my face the server said \"Let me see what I can do\". He then brought out a plate with three of the smallest cream puffs I have ever seen and a candle and just set it on the table with the check and walked away. Let me begin by saying that I was fine with not having any dessert or candles, and my boyfriend was only trying to make me feel special, but what the server said and how he acted was service that I have NEVER received anywhere, let alone somewhere where dinner for two cost us over $150. I have eaten on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi across the street at Paris for the view of the Belagio water show several times before, and unfortunately that is where I will be returning to.

We have ordered SMALL MANGO GREEN TEA WITH GRASS JELLO, LARGE CHOCOLATE MILK TEA + PEARL, LEMON KING + COCONUT JELLO, and TAPIOCA CHOCOLATE. There are two sizes of the drinks. The large one is like $5 and the small is $4. They used all the fresh seasonal ingredients. The customers can choose the size of the cup, ingredients, sugar level for their Bubble tea.

I hate to admit it but while I have a loyalty to my hair stylist in Green I follow special deals for my nails. Groupon was doing a special at Fringe so we all decided to go together on a \"girl day\". An added aspect I enjoyed was on their website you can fill out a \"appointment request\" form and someone will get back to you quickly via phone or e-mail. First off, the Fringe people are FABULOUS. Not only were they able to get all 3 of us in for mani/pedis at the same time, they seemed sincere in the effort to help group us together. They had two girls working on us and they were so friendly and it almost seemed like the 5 of us had been friends forever and were just hanging out. They were extremely patient and had genuine suggestions for nail color (let's be honest 3 mani/pedis are going to take awhile). While we were there my two girlfriends decided to get their eyebrows waxed as well after the nails and the girls at Fringe were only happy to help. Not only were the girls at Fringe extremely awesome, but the salon atmosphere was comfortable, open, and inviting....all elements I associate with a relaxing day trip to the salon. The salon is in a shopping plaza, but it looked like they had expanded into two stores so the whole salon is open and airy. The elegant decor made me feel as if I was at a high price salon. I would love to go back to Fringe solely for the inviting atmosphere and friendly staff. It's a place I could get loyal to about my nails. However, the prices are a little out of my limited budget. Prices are not crazy high, but like I said I really feel like I can only justify a mani/pedi when I have a special deal of $40 max for both. Total for spa mani/pedi at regular price = $68 (again I've seen worse)."

We had to leave the actual spa (in our robes) and go back to the spa check in lobby. The champagne bar was more of a smoothie bar. Since we were getting 3 glasses, we thought about getting a whole bottle. The girl wasn't of the prices so we waited while she checked on them. After finding out the prices, we opted for 3 glasses (overpriced, of course). We were told that there were no champagne glasses and they were trying to find some. After 15 minutes of not locating any, they called room service to bring us 3 glasses. We were not allowed to bring the champagne into the spa area so we waited in a waiting lounge for our champagne. It took 40 minutes! Room service came and delivered it to us for which we were charged a room service fee. You shouldn't charge a room service fee when you advertise a champagne bar and you don't have any glasses. The room service guy was very nice and the situation was not his fault so we didn't raise the issue with him. When we checked out of the spa, they did remove the room service fee after our complaining. But we never got an apology for the inconvenience or having to wait 40 minutes for the champagne. Overall, I loved the spa and would highly recommend it. Everything was fantastic, except the champagne experience which would be easier to overlook if it was just bad or not great but it was a disaster."

I have been here twice, the first time was quite a good experience, wait staff was on their game and very attentive. I had the Angus on wheat with swiss, jalapeno bacon and a fried egg. Very good burger, although the patty did lack some seasoning but that may just be a personal gripe as I opt for seasoned meat over a plethora of toppings. Do watch out for the first bite when getting the fried egg, lets just say it was closer to sunny side up than over medium. My second time at the BB I was a bit displeased with the overall experience. The hostesses were rude and there were 3 of them standing doing nothing at a podium made for one person. The only thing worse than the attitude was the fact that the wait was about an hour but I can deal with the wait, its Vegas and there is always something to do while you are waiting. On to the food, I mistakenly ordered the slider sampler thinking that I could get a taste of the buffalo and kobe burgers without having to order the entire burger. What I got was 3 small tasteless burgers that were on the slightly overcooked side. Least I had some sweet potato fries to help calm the hunger pangs. All in all if you like options and you like creativity you need to check this place out but be prepared to shell out an extra few bucks if you want to go all out. I have yet to try to the surf and turf burger...waiting to hit the progressive jackpot before shelling out the 30 bucks or so it is for that one."

I have several conditions and the combination of which plus my age makes my case really rare. This is the only doctor that believed me when I said something was wrong. I've been to countless doctors, specialists, physical therapy, etc. and after a few visits and implementation of suggested treatment I feel like a new person. He also understands who has good intentions and who doesn't. Old doctors accused me of making stuff up although I wasn't asking for anything, he actually believes I experience the pain and fatigue I do and is careful to work with me on it. The office staff and billing program needs work. I have heard of them making appointments that could be solved via mail/e-mail, overbooking and have 1hr+ waits, but I'd wait 2 hours to see Reynoso.

Good variety of topping, the noodles had a nice texture, and broth was flavourful without being too salty (ie I did not feel guilty about drinking the soup.). My only criticism of the menu is that I'd appreciate more vegetarian or vegan choices. For example, they had a lunchtime combo which started with pork or chicken broth (why not veggie)? And perhaps a couple more veggie apps to choose from beyond edamame and what's not already in the vegetarian ramen. Service was prompt, friendly, and enthusiastic.

The restaurant was not busy, with only a few tables of customers. We were greeted, seated and served with tea promptly. We ordered a steamed bass fish dish (1.5lb at $19/lb) and a chicken with vegetable dish ($11.50). The chicken was quite good: good flavour, beautifully plated, well portioned. The steamed fish was made from a live fish (many restaurants would steam a fresh dead fish). It was over cooked. I still found it enjoyable because the sauce was delicious. The services was wonderful: Servers were *extremely* friendly and chatty. There were free starter soup and dessert. Used plates were promptly replaced. Tea pot was promptly refilled. Fisherman Villa is a neighourhood restaurant that is suitable for regular family dining out. Pricing appears to be lower than other restaurants of similar class (mid-range). I would likely return because the overall offerings (selections, food, services, prices, location) are suitable for our family."

I also had a few friends who have done business with them and said good things. Because I didn't want to hang around for a five hour window (pun!), I opted to make an appointment at their shop which made it easier to approximate how long I would be down. The woman who made the appointment neglected to mention that the car needed to sit for an hour before driving so that the seal would set. Drag! The waiting area is decent with a television, free wifi and a play area for the kiddies. When done, the windshield was as good as new. The guy even replaced my oil change sticker on it. They offer wiper blade replacement as well, but I had just done mine a few months back NOTE! Safelite is NOT the cheapest around. I brought in a quote from another repair shop (just do a search on \"windshield repair quote\"). While they didn't match the $180 price, they did come down from $260 to $205 with tax. Considering the hassle that it would have been to make an appointment somewhere else, I figured it was worth $25. I can't say that this is their policy - I might have just caught them on a good day."

        "text": "A little background....I have been going to this location for about 3 years now. I train about 6 days a week and cycle through a few different gyms depending upon my needs. I travel quite a bit and have subs to Golds, LA Fitness and 24 Hours Super Sport. In the past I have worked as a personal trainer and am an Army vet whose MOS required a high level of physical ability. I perform a lot of proprioception (balance/stability) type routines mixed in with range of motion exercises and strength training. In my professional opinion the big pro of this gym is Kyle the trainer. In all my years both personally and professionally he is without a doubt the best trainer I have ever seen. Its not just his knowledge which is extensive, but the manner in which he interacts with his clients. This is a guy who is more than just passionate about what he does, he is a living example. He coaches, corrects and congratulates. I do not know Kyle personally, except in passing and watching him at work, but I have a great respect for him and only wish I could afford to hire him myself. I have worked with hundreds of trainers in my past including elite military trainers, some of whom are still my friends, and without any doubt I would still rate Kyle as the best. In terms of the gym itself it is actually fairly small when compared to almost every other 24 hour gym in town, except for the one that is downtown. I am often hard pressed to find the space I need to train on a bosu or stability ball which I use extensively throughout my workout. They have a dance/aerobic room upstairs but its not really convenient to keep running up the stairs between sets. As well, the mens locker room is pretty small and can get very cramped during peak hours. Amazingly I have never had a problem finding a free locker. In the last year or so the gym has really suffered in terms of cleanliness and the overall state of the equipment. The mens bathroom is horrendous during the daytime hours and they even took out the paper towel dispenser some months ago. This is also the one gym where I rarely see any of the staff make an effort to help put away weights or equipment even during the late evening hours. As with most gyms people seem to grow tired or lazy when it comes to re-racking their weights and the whole place becomes its own obstacle course. On the positive side (for me anyways) this location has a pretty hardcore clientele. When Golds gym on sandhil closed this was my go-to gym for hardcore motivation. It's nothing like seeing Cutler, Wolf or Burneike workout at Golds/Sandhill but there are a lot of elite people here and quite a few vets. The biggest negative for me at this gym is the management, namely Martin the GM. A few years ago when I started here the staff was incredibly friendly. The manager at the time would even come out to say hello and meet people. This recent manager is rude, unfriendly and dismissive. Of all my friends who work out here, not one has anything positive to stay about him and in fact all my interactions have been very negative. I have 2 friends specifically who have left this gym because of his mistreatment. The good news is that ever since Martin showed up the gym has in my opinion gotten less crowded during the day time when I am usually there. Of course it could just be coincidence or me getting less attentive as I age, but I won't dismiss the obvious either. Another negative for me is they actually recently hired a trainer, who might even be the training manager now who has tatoos on his calfs that read \" Cheaters always WIN\" and \"Winners always Cheat\". This to me is the very antithesis of my own personal journey. I am sure he thought it was funny at the time or perhaps it played to some whimsical sentiment but it seems completely contrary to the whole idea of hiring a trainer in the first place. If you are looking for some hardcore customers to stay motivated and the best trainer in Kyle, this gym is a great option. However, be prepared to overlook the poor management and less than perfect facilities. Update: Added a 4th star. This location has a new manager who is a huge improvement. I had cancelled my membership but re-upped with Steve (might be Mike, the service manager I believe)."

The ice cream shop shares their place with a sandwich shop. It's a small fridge with nice options. Since I'm going dairy free and egg free (as much as possible at the moment), I asked for their dairy options and it was the sorbets. They had pi\u00f1a colada and orange. I picked orange because the pi\u00f1a colada had a little bit of alcohol. I chose the big size which is pretty big and is $5. The sorbet tasted good; my husband and I shared it. It had a slightly bitter after taste which made us think they used the rind while making it. Overall, it had great flavor and was very refreshing though. Wish I was able to try the other great options they had on display. Reviews seemed really great!"

I had written a very unfavorable review with a one-star rating but, for whatever reason, I tabled the review and decided to attempt to contact Mr. Kenny directly with my concerns. Not only did Mr. Kenny promptly respond to my email, he actually gave me his personal cell phone number and invited me to call him, even though he was spending time with his family in Chicago!! Of course I was not going to call him during his family time, but he also responded with a very detailed message (once again, while he was on vacation with his family) apologizing for the mix-up, explaining what actually happened and what steps he'd take with his new employee to insure the information given to me would be clearer for future clients. For anyone wondering about the mixup, it dealt with the fact that if they represent you for a traffic ticket that results in a claim to your insurance, they CANNOT promise that your insurance will not go up, as they erroneously did with me. From what I now understand, your insurance will not go up based on the parking ticket, but from the actual claim.....a differentiation that I was not made aware of and that Mr. Kenny promised his staff assistant would explain better in the future. Since the firm WAS able to reduce the ticket to a parking ticket with no points and no traffic school and since the rise in my insurance seems to have been out of their hands, I'll give them 4-stars. Also, for Mr. Kenny's professionalism and unexpected personal touch, I will give this firm serious consideration if I'm ever in need of a lawyer in Las Vegas in the future."

After that they drop you off to pay for your pumpkins at the top of the hill. .45 cents per pound. Not bad! They had a corn maze, slide, boo barn, scarecrow building station, marshmallow roast, funnel cakes, kettle corn, and a concession stand. Lots of activities for the kiddies to enjoy!

I love how they setup the menu/ordering sheet with a reusable ordering board (environmentally friendly). The restaurant itself is a very typical Asian noodle place, with a bench seat that's very high and a table plus chair. Very functional and not much in terms of decor. So we placed our order after choosing all the options. (Note, it comes with a free drink). Not long after, our dinner came out and we started. We chose a blend of vermicelli and noodle with a fish soup and a Vietnamese Pho style noodle soup. We liked our dishes, so food ain't bad. No complaints. And my overall experience was alright."

It was around 6 p.m. after the Cleveland Browns game at 1 p.m. so there was a 15-30 min wait, but we were able to find two spots at the bar after about five minutes of waiting. They have text message alerts for when your table is ready so you don't have to stand around and wait, either. We both had the \"Our Burger\" the basic burger, and their secret sauce is basically thousand island. The buns are awesome and chewy but crisp, the pickles were really tasty, and it really was a high quality burger. I would say a little on the greasy end. We also shared a fries for about $3.50 that was plenty for the both of us. They are cut pretty thick. The restaurant was playing mostly 90s and popular music, they have tons of flat screens showing sports, and there are movie ads for Mark's movies on the way to the bathroom. Our bartender was very sweet and responsive (they have forgotten a side of sauce I wanted but she got it within a few seconds). This is only a few blocks away from where we live downtown so definitely can see coming again. It is really close to the casino and the sketchier area of downtown but inside it seems mostly families and was clean."

We missed the first turn because I was on the look out a sign that said \"Angie & Jimmie's Pizza\", but only saw \"PIZZA\" on the window of a shack. We made a u-ey to get a closer look and thinking the parking lots connected with the porno shop, we pulled in too soon. Lo & behold, the parking lots did not connect so we slinkied into the restaurant, hoping no one passing by would recognize our cars parked at the XXX lot. Anyhow, we took a seat in the dining area and cracked jokes about the lame interior-- empty (clean) pizza boxes stacked against the wall, old arcades in the corner and crappy plastic patio furniture.. Even though I don't drink soda, the free soda fountain was a nice option. It even dispenses horchata! We ordered a deluxe large pizza, 26 BBQ wings and an order of fries. The pizza was pretty good, but the folded over crust was kind of weird, wings were meaty (albeit a bit too saucy) and the fries were OK-- nicely seasoned w/ spices, but too greasy and not crispy. I'd give it 3.5 stars, but rounded up because the service was friendly. $36 pre-tax for 3 people w/ leftovers."

        "text": "An update as I have visited Sweet Tomatoes quite often in the last couple of months. It's mostly some little gripes that I have and I need to vent. Sweet Tomatoes seems to have an obsession with Asiago cheese. They have 3 types of focaccia bread, all of them with Asiago Their 2 main salads have Asiago cheese. Seriously? I personally don't like Asiago and would like to see some more variety or at least use a more universally accepted cheese (mozzarella would be nice). Or at least don't mix it everywhere! Then another staple salad they have, Won Ton Chicken barely has any chicken! Why not call it Won Ton salad? And what about the desserts? The warm apple cobbler tastes like a homemade one, with large chunks of fresh apple and pleasantly sweet, but not overly so, syrup. Sweet potatoes with maple butter are amazing, definitely try these. The brownie muffins and fudge brownie are not always sweet (sometimes they're just right, others time they have a dark chocolate taste but the fudge brownie really lacks the \"fudge\", it tastes \"watered down\" somehow). Banana bread muffins are nice and soft with a pleasant taste of banana (no banana chunks) as are the apple cinnamon muffins. The sugar free chocolate mousse is amazing as always, light and fluffy. The soft serve ice cream is actually yogurt and you can't really tell the difference. There's a choice of toppings like chocolate and caramel syrup, chocolate sprinkles, nuts and cookie crumbles. The cookie crumbles are relatively dry and hard, they're not \"cookie dough\" chunks you're used to seeing in ice cream. Overall good for a salad buffet with healthy dessert alternatives. Keep in mind that Sweet Tomatoes (slighly) change their menu every 2 weeks(ish) so some items may be missing while others are always there."

I wasn't with my wife when she picked up the Kimchee so I have no idea what the market is like. By the way for those not in the know -Kimchee is a traditional fermented Korean side dish usually made with a variety of seasonings that is allowed to ferment underground in jars for months at a time. It is Korea's national dish, with a main vegetable ingredient such as napa cabbage. Frankly I was doubtful the Kimchee would be as good as I have got at some Korean restaurants, especially coming from a market. It definitely wasn't as \"strong\" as I like it or have tasted before. However their Kim Chi far exceeded my expectations. It was amazingly delicious. The Kimchi is ctually better than what you can get in most restaurants and not all that expensive. While at the market Carol also got some Sushi that was pre-packaged. All the package said was \"Koren Sushi\" so I have no idea what kind of Suchi it was. Whatever it was it was interesting, tasty, different and unique, nothing that I've seen or tried before and I love Sushi. Lets just say I was pleasantly surprised. Not the best out there. However, it is definitely better than average (at least from what I've had in the past year) . Remember this is from a market not a Sushi restaurant.

Iced tea (Nestea) and pop are both humanely priced at $1, which is much appreciated when you're having a non-alcoholic night and don't want to be gouged for being a teetotaller. I say no to \"good for groups\" because this place is narrower than a matchstick and unwieldy when at capacity. The bathrooms, as expected, are terrifying. The decor is kinda dumpy but you'll surely find something to fall in love with: Smurf figurines on the countertop, mismatched portraits of high school crushes like Ruhollah Khomeini and Yoko Ono, or perhaps the macrame barn owl that I secretly want to steal for my bathroom wall??"

When we mentioned it to our waitress she went to the kitchen and learned that the restaurant doesn't actually have honey garlic flavouring for chicken wings. So we ended up with the BBQ wings, the wings were a bit dry but the BBQ flavour was pretty good. For my main course, I ordered the Brooklyn bridge pizza. I ordered it without the pine nuts and added bacon. This pizza was fantastic. It wasn't greasy at all. I would definitely recommend this pizza to anyone, I would definitely order it again. The restaurant itself is clean, uncluttered and the artwork is very nice. I could do without their choice of music though, not a big fan of current pop music. Overall, a good restaurant."

As advertised, their food does have a very Mumbai taste to it. If you have been living in Toronto for a while, you'll agree with me when I say that no matter which Indian restaurant you go to in Toronto, the Malai Kofta, Shahi Paneer, Paneer Tikka and Palak Paneer are basically identical at all the major Indian restaurants. Not at this place though. The chef is the owner and he's created his own recipes for the different dishes they offer. My family goes there once every two weeks and have been a regular there ever since they discovered the restaurant. The cleanliness at the new spot is great. The staff is reasonably courteous. The food is delicous. For the Gujarati people looking for the \"Indian\" taste of the curries, this is the place to go.

The place was quite packed and loud. After all, it is located on busy Queen Street. I didn't particularly like the high seat chairs with no back rest. I ordered a black tea with sugar, milk and their cornmeal waffles with fried cornish hen with a side salad. This costs me around $30 with tips and taxes. It was quite busy on this Sunday so the order took a while in getting to us. The waiter actually recommended the cornish hen. So what exactly is cornish hen? In summary, its a smaller chicken with gamier meat. It was deep fried with batter and came with a tangy sauce. It was cooked well, tasted alittle gamy and crunchy and crispy. The cornmeal waffles were a first for me as well. It was alittle on the bland side but I guess its complimentary flavour. The side salad was a mix of spring greens with a light drizzle of olive oil. The waffles were good and came with a watery version of maple syrup. I quite enjoyed my meal and would love to have it again. Overall, I would definitely visit here again for the waffles and cornish hen."

We generally plan our trips out so we don't spend WAY too much and we can get in and out in as little as 20 minutes if we need to. We often stop at the food court first, so we're not shopping while we're hungry. 2 slices of pizza and 2 drinks for just about $5. You can't really beat that anywhere. It's good pizza, too - aside from needing a whole pack of napkins to soak up the grease! The store is laid out well and items are generally not too difficult to find. There was one time I REALLY wanted asparagus, but I went to the cooler and ALL of the bags had already started to turn. I told the first employee we passed and he went straight to the cooler to check it out and do what was necessary. He was professional and prompt. All in all, I really do like Costco, and I like this location better than the others (I've been to all)."

My order contained a chocolate Milkshake, a double burger which half a pound, double patty burger. And five jumbo wings. I Will start with what I didn't like and that was the wings, I went with a poutine style wings and honestly the toppings was the best pair, makes me what to try their poutine. The chicken itself really lacked favour or any taste. It was chicken but it was taste less, I probably stick to burgers or try to fried chicken but im on the fence about that. Also, for the claim to be jumbo, they were nothing more then average size. so that another think I got knock them down for. On to the main course, the double patty, double burger, this was a half pound (8 0z)burger, that's a standard size for me. The patty was juicy and tasty, I could eat another one. The only thing that made less enjoyable was the lettuce but that can be fixed by no lettuce next time. I hear they're sauce are suppose to be good, maybe I got try one of their sauce favour on my burger. The last part of my meal was the shake. Hard to mess up a chocolate shake and they didn't. it had nice, rich cremy taste to it, so good. It wasn't lumpy or anything. Probably going to have another the next time. Someone esle also order a shake because mine looked so good. If that isnt a sign then I don't know what is Wings- 2/5- poutine sauce saved it a bit, Burger- 4/5- lettuce, Chocolate shake- 5/6, this was the real star and hidden gem. The cooks, and the lady behind the cash were friendy, good service, seem to be known with locals, and have a few regulars based on my observation and based on ,my experience, I don't see why anyone wont want keep going there"

The changing rooms are pretty nice and clean, there are lockers with a code that can be used for no extra charge. Washrooms (inside the changing rooms) look little weird but not bad.

The only negative we find here is the music on the deck is a bit too loud if one sits by the door and the Athena's Garden had too much pesto (there was enough for a few plates) the one time my wife tried it (at the next visit we asked about it and the chef may have been a bit exuberant with the pesto that day).

This is a good place to come in a group. There were five of us and we were seated at table with a little grill in the middle. The meal starts with a combination of appetizers and items to be used with grilling--although not clear to me the differences between the two. The salad and kimchi were good--the kimchi was thankfully not too hot. There was also an odd sweet soup--although we were not sure if it was a sauce or soup (although our server clarified that it was soup). I did not care for that. We ordered the beef combo, where you get five different meats along with prawns. The meats were excellent. Thankfully our server was there to cook the meat. --The first course was brisket, cut thinly. Although a little fatty, it was tasty. --Second was a ribeye. It could have have been seasoned better, but was cooked really well. This was served with mushrooms--also good, but lacking seasoning. --Third was prime rib sushi which the server cooked using a little torch. This was superb, I could have eaten ten of those. --Fourth was a skirt steak. This had a wonderful marinade and was really good. This was served with grilled pineapple which did not make sense. --The final beef dish was short ribs. They were heavenly. --It ended with prawns that again had no seasoning, but were still good. To finish, the server brought out marshmallows, chocolate, and little rice cakes for S'mores. This was a great finish and a lot of fun to make. Their alcohol menu is limited and the tea they brought out was odd. It was barley-flavored and started hot, then was served cold later. All during the meal the servers yelled out odd things.

Melt salads are a staple of my diet and you can read my check in for the details of the awesomeness of their house and Asian noodle salads. Besides the salads, the other thing I love about melt, again atypical, is the fact that they have plentiful vegan and vegetarian options - which is not what one would think of when one thinks of melt. Any sandwich that you get can be made with vegan cheese (I'll leave it up to you to decide if the lack of lacto is worth the lack of flavor: vegan cheese sandwiches here are more similar to melted frisbee sandwiches, tbh, but maybe vegan cheese is a flavor one's palate grows accustomed to?), many melt sandwiches are vegetarian, and the servers \"get\" most other dietary restrictions. So, if you know Melt as a restaurant with sandwiches you cannot even finish, go back, and give them another try--for everything else."

Great smiling service though the cashier was missing a tooth, not that there is anything wrong with that. \"Small or regular.\" \"Cash, Debit or Credit.\". \"Great thanks.\" The phrases came automatically but genuinely enough to know that I was communicating with a person. The details permeate down to the credit machine which told me that the machine is checked twice a day (I'll assume for information stealing devices and not for germs) and is stored in safe place after hours. Wonderful! I suppose I'll take their word for it. Though there was one person ahead of me, it took 30 seconds to have my drink ready. Impressed, I was. And as always it was deliciously satisfying.

I like to always make reservations but I didn't. When we arrived all of the main dining tables were full, but we were lucky enough to get a table in the bar. If you come, make a reservation! It was pretty good. We ordered the New York strip with foie gras, the halibut and au gratin potatoes. No martinis for us. We wanted the Far Niente Red but they were out. Our waitress recommended the Archery Summit Pinot Noir instead. Fantastic choice. Cons: The food took a little while to come. There was not salt and pepper on the table. I understand that chefs like to season a certain way, but some of us like a little extra salt and pepper! The Halibut was over cooked and dry :/ disappointing. Pros: the wine recommendation was amazing (I'm searching to see where I can buy it in LA). The steak was pretty good. Asked for rare, came a little over rare but still good. The foie gras was amazing, though I've never had it before so I have nothing to compare it to. They also brought us a foie gras appetizer (I think because the food took a bit longer to come). That was also delish, and a great gesture on the restaurants part. The potatoes were pretty good, they had nutmeg in them (which I like but some people don't). Other than that everything was pretty good. There was a musician playing in the bar, who was fantastic... But sitting at the table right next to her trying to talk to my dad who's hard of hearing was a bit difficult. I would come back again for the wine, steak and foie gras. Our waitress was also a pretty good. Can't remember her name, but she's the one with the fantastic blond hair all styled up (Samantha maybe?)."

The same happened on a previous visit when I wanted veggie pho. They delivered a bowl brimming with garden treats: broccoli, bok choy, celery, carrots. That's what I am talking about when I am talking about vegetables, not onion and cilantro. Those don't count in pholand. Again, this was not on the menu, but when I asked the waiter, he knew what I wanted and said they could do it. The broth is simple, perhaps not as flavorful as my favorite bowl of pho. For me, though, the dose of veggies is more important than a perfectly flavored broth. And, the noodles? Wow, there were a lot of noodles, and they were not mushy. They do noodles right. Between the sandwich and the pho, the food is definitely a solid 3, and I am adding a bonus star for being incredibly nice and credit card friendly! Those two things go a long way."

I would be the first to say that hotel restaurants or restaurants connected to the hotel are often mediocre and high priced. This restaurant is neither. They serve both Cantonese and Szechuan cuisines but the main draw is the dimsum. Dimsum is served from the traditional metal carts. Diners simply pick which item they want and the server then marks the price of the item on the provided check. All the traditional favorites are available like pork siu mai, har gau, pot stickers, egg rolls, fried crab claws, char siu bao, etc., as well as, the more exotic items such as chicken feet. Congee is also an option with all the necessary fixings. For dessert, they really did an excellent job with egg tarts and sesame seed balls. The other dessert items are still great options. There are also some dimsum items (mostly dessert) that are served from a dedicated table. As with the carts, diners simply pick which item they want. Despite the variety of dimsum items available, it is clear that quality was not sacrificed. The only areas that could be improved is service by wait staff (slow and not very responsive) and decor (dining room flooring and walls could be refurbished)."

Tender, seasoned and grilled perfectly. Always cooked to order. The specialty platters are enormous, so don't order unless you are hungry. The Greek Salad has a near perfect light and flavorful dressing, the only downside is depending on who is in the kitchen you may get overly large lettuce chunks which makes eating awkward. It is recommended you ask them to toss your salad for you, it will evenly spread the dressing and Fetta around - completely changes the flavor and quality. If you like hummus, get the hummus with seasoned beef. Out of this world and simple but flavorful. The decor and ambience are the only downsides. You feel like you are in a covered hotel banquet room, or having dinner at a retirement home. The lighting, background music, and overall space are a 2 out of 5. Service is a hit or miss. A few of the staff there are fantastic, but, they randomly handle tables and so you sometimes may wait to get acknowledged. However, the food quality if worth the wait. WARNING: Ordering to-go is a painful experience unless you tell them you will be there in 15-20 minutes. I have ordered sometimes, showed up 45 minutes later, and they were still not ready. If you don't tell them you need it fast, you will wait a while. And walk-in takeout is the worst - just plan on a long wait."

        "text": "Greenberg's Deli brings back that loving feeling that's been gone gone gone. Born and raised in the New York metropolitan area I grew up with the loving feeling of dining in delis that serve delicacies from kasha varnishes to Ruben sandwiches. After moving to Las Vegas there has been far less New York delis to enjoy the these delicacies that I love. I am surprised that it took my brother and I over 15 years to try Greenberg's Deli. Better late than never. It is appropriate that Greenberg's Deli sits inside New York - New York within a Disneyfied Greenwich Village. Both casino and Deli execute such a commendable job with the theme and attention to detail, that a unique dining experience is guaranteed. The New York City motif is so realistic that you expect to hear a taxi careening down the faux Greenwich Village Street, and instead overhear a runaway Manhattan Rollercoaster taxi above with screaming riders. When you step off the Greenwich Village Street into Greenberg's Deli, up above on the wall is the menu. It advertises the New York City Deli icons including the Ruben, corn beef, and pastrami. Disappointedly yet totally expected Kashe varnishes and kinishes were missing. However, there on the board was an egg salad sandwich. I LOVE egg salad sandwiches. They are not the easiest sandwich to find in Las Vegas and especially on the Strip. A few years past, I really enjoyed the Johnny Rockets egg salad sandwich until they got rid of it. The egg salad sandwich is relatively inexpensive for the Las Vegas Strip where a Subway sandwich could cost over $8. I would never want to eat an egg salad sandwich by itself. I'd add a prepackaged potato salad for $1.50 and a fountain Pepsi for a couple of dollars more that came out to $13 and change. Before I could enjoy the food I had to pay. This is a two line process. On line 1, I ordered and picked up the sandwich with the prepackaged potato salad and fountain Pepsi before bringing my tray to line 2 to pay. I carried the tray outside to the Greenwich Village Street where the tables are. The egg salad sandwich brought back this loving feeling of enjoying delicious food in a New York deli. They served it on between two slices of rye bread (I could of had sourdough). Complimenting the overflowing egg salad that required a fork to savour every bite was onions, tomato, and lettuce. The potato salad was nothing extraordinary. Perhaps, the next time I visit I may enjoy the sandwich with hard to find Wise potato chips or go nearby upstairs to Coney Island to pick up Nathan's crinkley cut fries. Sitting in the Greenwich Village Street amplified this New York state of mind that in reality is a New York - New York state of mind. The sights and sounds of the casino is exciting. Up above the runaway New York Express roller coaster taxi careened on the tracks, the Times Square Dueling Piano players rocked the classics across Greenwich Village. Greenberg's Deli with the New York - New York Greenwich Village is the marriage of a Las Vegas and New York deli dining experience that brings back a loving feeling that had been gone gone gone."

Hell, step outside and look...oh yea, nevermind I forgot my glasses. LoL! I think that was my only issue about the place. OKay, so I got a 8\" sub with a large fountain drink - 8 bucks. Not bad. I don't remember what it was called, I think it was the #12. It had avocado, provelone and turkey slices. I love that they pile on a lot of shredded lettuce on it. I asked for sprouts, but she heard sauce. And it got slapped with mayo. Whatever, I was hungry and it still tasted good, except with all that sauce the insides kept slidding out the back everytime I took a bite. The place was nice, seating is limited. They do have some outside tables. The music is a little too loud. The cashier was patient as we hemmed and hawed and helpful when we asked questions. Once we ordered, the sandwhichs were put together very quickly and the name of your sandwhich yelled out for you at the other end. All 4 of us enjoyed our sandwhichs. 1 coworker got a pickle to eat later. When she opened it later that day, it was sliced in 4, and she gave me one. OMG! I know what I'm getting next time."

Before entering, there was a helpful usher that split people into the proper lines and guided them towards the right entrance. Our tickets were scanned, and more ushers guided us towards our seats. Definitely no issues with service, that's for sure. Now, the detail of the theater was simply unique! Long walkways all along the walls that really made you wonder. Near showtime, you start to see performers walk across them in costume. From there they joined the crowd, stalking and lurking on people trying to make their way to their seats. Especially preying on late arrivals; So don't be late for the show or you'll be spotlighted. Talk about an intentional embarrassment. It was pretty funny, and I pretty much knew we were in for a great show. Here's a few of the highlights I enjoyed: ~ The martial arts experts: These included the good guys, warriors and archers. Their moves and stunts were simply astonishing and impressive. ~ The outfits: Talk about Flash Gordon-like! From the mountain tribesmen, forrest people and moving animals on the beach, they all had a crazy array of color. Way cool! ~ The rotating moveable stages: With the circling sinking boat which was freakin' awesome to see, to the mountain wall that stood some 90+ feet up. Man I was speechless in awww! Even the backdrop of certain scenes were simply extraordinary. ~ The acrobatic moves on or along the stage or in the air: They flew around the audience like humans with no fear; I couldn't believe my eyes! And the guy doing jump-rope on the human hamster-wheel. Holy crap, I was praying for this guy's safety. ~ But probably my most favorite highlight, or shall I say highlights were: 1) The shadow puppets. Not sure I've ever seen a mastered hand puppet show. Definitely remarkable. 2) The scene following the boat sinking: I enjoyed the lone maiden in water with the floating bubbles in, \"breathtaking\"! As for the ending... They must've altered it, because there was no video ending at the time we went. Just fireworks and the unity of the tribes becoming peaceful. Now, I came to this show not knowing about the accidental death. Very saddened to read news about it later. I'm giving an honorable fifth star for heart: The performers gave it their all, as I'm sure she did as well."

However, awhile ago I saw the reviews on yelp and I made my way there before hitting the gym. And omg everything there were so inexpensive. They have cute dresses which are good for night out and clubbing, and they are on an average about 30 dollars each which is really awesome. I got two clubbing dresses and a tshirt for 60 dollars and change which is about the same as forever 21.

Overall, my kids love it and if its just something quick without having to leave the strip..with kids..this is not too bad. 1 slice is already huge so 1 for 2 young kids 3 & 5 is more then enough for them. The pizza is actually pretty fresh. Better then ordering any chain pizza places near home. I especially like the dough they use for the crust. No doubt this is one of my stops when my kids are craving pizza and and the prices are not bad as I said. I think you can get 2 slices with a drink for around $10?

Our server was great, their mixed drinks were great (at one point I ordered Jameson on the rocks and I was given the option to add an extra 1.5oz for an extra $3, not sure what other drinks that goes for, but I'm sure the server will inform you if it is an option), last but not least the food was amazing!! I would highly recommend the following: - Gyro Tacos which comes with lamb meat, but it probably will not be everyone's cup of tea for those who like to steer away from meat that tastes too gamey. - Veal Meatballs is topped with Foie Gras cream, need I say more? - Bacon Jam & Brie - The bacon jam comes sizzling hot with a melted slab of brie cheese on top, served with toasted bread. - Fried Chicken Skin with Honey Dip - each piece is crisp to perfection, my friend had one order all to herself. - Butter Burger with a side of Tater Tots - flavor packed between two soft buns. Other things that were ordered that is worth trying: - Smashed Potatoes - It's not mashed pototoes, it a baked potato sliced into 2-3 pieces with sour cream and chives on top. - Tempura Green Beans - A great appetizer to munch on. - NY Strip Steak - we ordered medium rare and the outcome was exactly like so, and very tender. Will definitely be paying Carson Kitchen another visit in the future when I'm in Las Vegas again."

I tried everything from Audi to Honda. I took my time. Even test drive cars like the Camaro and Mustang because I could and thought it would be fun. There's a definite difference between the BMW sales approach and the Audi sales approach compared to everywhere else. There's less pressure and more respect. At Honda there was a guilt trip for wanting to do more research. At Chevy, the conversation was centered around how rich in women the car would make me (cleaned that up a bit for the review). And the Cadillac sales guy lacked confidence in the product that he was selling stating; \"you're not here if you're worried about safety; you're here for an image.\" At this dealership I came back multiple times. Test drove different models, was shown everything I asked to see, and was never pressured. I of course had to negotiate for the best price. I paid what I expected. Ferri was my sales associate. She was very nice and professional and not at all pushy. Since purchase I have been back for courtesy services and have been checked in on several times. Car washes, service, and education on my purchase are all included. With regard to this location compared to Summerlin; I did attempt to test drive with a friend at the Summerlin location but my friend states she was not treated with the same respect at Summerlin as she was here because of how she was dressed.

We both ordered vegetarian tortas and both loved them. Again, full of flavor and a great combination. Finally, we split tres leches for desert which was excellent as well. Portions are very large. Food was all prepared very well and plated with care. Service: Seated immediately. Our waitress was phenomenal. She was always there to refill our waters and salsa/chips without hovering or interrupting. Food quick, but could have come a tad quicker -- it was a Friday night, so can't really complain too much. Atmosphere: Nice. We ate outside in colder weather and the heaters made it cozy. Inside was chill, less cramped than other restaurants, and the music wasn't obnoxiously loud. Prices: The food is all really well priced. Two entrees and a split desert came to 26$. Drinks were rather expensive -- about $10+ for anything but bottled beer -- so we decided not to order any."

Delicious food, good service. I was impressed by the menu while I was looking for a new Thai place to try, a place that is far from center. If you're already tired of typical Thai foods, please come to this place please please please. They won't let you down. At first, I wanted to order Crab Rangoon, Chicken Satay, Crispy Tofu, Duck Roll but my bf wanted Golden Cup, Steamed Dumpling and Bang Bang Shrimp. I know it's a lot but sorry, they're too really unique to make me want to try all of them. But finally we just got Bang Bang Shrimp - omg a hidden gem, a star, it's like Coconut milk-Curry Shrimp. Must try must try, if you're not a fan of curry, you can skip it. The Shrimp wasn't over cooked so you can fell the freshness, and that's what I love. Another one we got was Panna Sampler - Chicken Satay yay, Tofu a Eggplant skewer - uhm no and Crab Rangoon yasss. However, Tofu&Eggplant killed me softly, its sauce is..... sorry words are useless to express. Please try. Chicken satay was okay, a little bit salty, but not bad at all. We also order Tom Yum soup like usual but it's too sour. The last ones were Basil Noodle - flat noodle with meats, eggs, onions, basil and bell peppers for my bf and Crab Fried Rice for me. He loved the noodle, it's tasty i think. My Crab Fried Rice had a alot of crab meat and eggs, it's good too, I've been trying it at different places but That St Cafe has the best one. Thai Iced Tea was a little bit sweet for me. And we finished 2 appetizers, 1 soup, 2 main dishes, 1 drinks, total was just $52 no tax&tip, we had take out the leftovers.

At first I was a little hesitant because we had our 14 month old daughter with us, but everyone was very accommodating and warm. Service was friendly and attentive. We ordered the meatballs and fresca salad to start. The meatballs were served piping hot with soft, fresh bread and a bright, delicious red sauce. The arugula salad was very crisp and the balsamic vinaigrette was delicious. We then followed up with the Santa Lucia pizza with pistachio pesto and spicy sausage, which was absolutely divine. Seriously, some of the best pizza I've had in a long time, and I eat pizza on a fairly regular basis. The crust is thin and crisp, and is perfectly cooked throughout--doesn't get soggy in the middle. Everything was perfect for the three of us to share, and we left satisfied and without any guilt on price. An appetizer, soft drink, generously large salad, and pizza split between two adults and a toddler came to $45 and was plenty for dinner. We would have stayed for dessert if it hadn't been so close to bedtime. Can't wait to go back! Just a note about the atmosphere as well: it can get pretty loud, but we weren't bothered because we have a small child."

A few years ago there was a little deli counter here that I loved and I was so disappointed when I found out they had closed. Then when I came in to get my own library card in April I saw there was a new cafe again! This is a non-profit business that benefits an organization that provides job training for women and helps them with domestic violence, sexual assault and substance abuse issues including housing, support groups, medical and legal assistance. All the workers are volunteers as I understand it. There is even a gift shop to help raise money for the cause. All right there on the library premises where you can stop by before or after you check out your materials. Not only are the volunteers cheerful and helpful but the food is delicious! My favorite is the chicken salad sandwich, followed close by the tuna salad. They serve a variety of coffees and smoothies, a few simple breakfast items and desserts, snow cones, Italian sodas (which I usually get) Frappes, etc. There is usually a Daily Special and you can get a combo with chips and drink. Everything I've had here was wonderful. There is another location of Cup O'Karma up in Mesa on Southern, too."

Luckily, I have found one of the oldest delis in town. Bagels N More is a small building on the corner of Eastern and Flamingo, and you would never know it from the outside, but offers the best breakfast in the area. With dozens of flavors of bagels to choose from, along with a variety of cream cheeses, Bagels N More lives up to its name. I don't know exactly how long it's been open, but I'm going to go with decades. Or at least it looks like decades. But the dcor doesn't matter. The menu is standard for a deli breakfast, but the taste is superior. Eggs, bagels, bacon, sausage, lox, orange juice, hash browns, etc. It really feels and tastes like a home-cooked meal. The lunch menu is pretty good too with corned beef sandwiches, salads, soups, and more. Dr. Browns sodas line the cases, and different muffins are available on the counter everyday. The service isn't so friendly, but I cut them a break because they may very well have worked their since the day Bagels N More opened. If you have a craving for a good breakfast, this is the place if you are around the area. Recommended breakfast: A bagel is a must, but anything else on the menu is pretty much a winner. Recommended lunch: The matzah ball soup with half a chicken sandwich sounds good right about now!"

And then viola, with his determination and the use of a larger machine he got the clog cleared and it is flowing like it never did before. I think Roy was just as happy as I was; It is clear that he cared about the customer and not over-charging or recommending unnecessary solutions; The cost was very reasonable.

Yes, I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw the word \"vegan\" on the menu. Of course I ordered myself a carnitas burrito and my gf the black bean taco (also included rice, lettuce, tomatoes, onion, and cilantro). My gf could not stop raving about the flavorful beans and refreshing toppings. She even hates cilantro but found herself liking Reyna's cilantro. The other vegan option is SOYRIZO! Yes, you heard me! I was in shock when my gf mentioned \"That bean taco was so good I don't even want to try the soyrizo. Just give me more of those beans!\" So there you have it. Even if you're not a big bean fan, taco fan, or fan of the strip district - this taco stand is worth the trip. Price is either $3/taco or $5/2 tacos. Cash only. On a side note, my carnitas taco was also really flavorful. I can't wait to go back and try the other meats they offer."

So my friend didn't feel like driving \"all the way over\" (5 whole miles) to our regular spot and mentioned Temari and based on the reviews we decided to give it a whirl. SSSSsoooooo glad we did! Nice atmosphere, kind of reminded us of a NY restaurant, long & not very wide, full of good food and conversation. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. Average prices for the most part, although we gorged ourselves silly and the bill was testament to that! I was a little leery about the huge amount of rolls they had on the menu, but we sampled 6 or 7 different ones and enjoyed them all. LOVED a few. The Hot & Saucy and Primo rolls were our absolute favorites, the former highly recommended by a lady sitting nearby. Both were nice and spicy and fresh, well made and so damn tasty. Their chili sauce and garlic sauce rock, and contrasted nicely with another roll we got that had a lemony sauce. They have a large variety of rolls from savory to spicy and a few on the sweeter side. If they do them all as well as the ones we tried, kudos to them. The sashimi tasted fresh to us and was nicely done as well, we had some different tunas and unagi, they were all good. Now I just have to find more sushi buddies so I can go often!! Oh and another bonus, less kids than at other places we've been :)"

The cupcakes were moist, the flavours were true, and the price was on point. For 24 mini cupcakes and 1 standard cupcake with a personal greeting, our total was $43.75, including taxes and delivery. I've visited bakeries all over Toronto and I know I couldn't get a better price anywhere else. I placed my order over the phone with a very pleasant Jane after reviewing flavours and pricing on their website. I called Wednesday afternoon requesting a Friday morning delivery, knowing that there was a slim chance in heck I'd get an affirmative answer, but Jane and Mike made it work for me - Mike even showed up earlier than I'd expected and closer to the time I had requested(before opening hours). I will support small businesses whenever I reasonably can, and people who put the time and effort into offering great service and an exceptional product gain loyal customers, as Dolled Up Cupcakes have in me. They will be my go to for deliciousness when I need an extra special touch that I can't quite get from my homemade goodies, and I am already planning to place another order next for cake pops I will surprise my friends with after our next dinner party. I'm sure I won't be disappointed."

Service was a little wacky with many different waitresses and servers coming to our table but they were all cordial. There is a sushi buffet for lunch, but they also have an option where you can get 2 rolls for $7 or 3 rolls for $9. It was so cheap that my expectations weren't very high but the sushi was definitely better than some fancier/more expensive rolls I've had in the past. They are small, but 2 is perfect if you aren't super hungry. I like how there isn't a super thick coating of rice around the fish, which happens at other buffet places. I'd recommend the buffet if you have a large appetite or came with a large group of people. I also tried a spicy beef dish off the Chinese szichuan menu and it was very tender. It is definitely spicy though. For the price and quality, this place can't be beat."

Omg the crack sauce is incredible. But tonight I ordered the wedge salad with a chicken meatball, and I don't think I'll be able to order anything else again. It was perfection. Their ranch dressing is bomb and the bacon and hard boiled eggs with the meatball was sooo good. The meatballs are super juicy and moist on the inside and just the right amount of crispy on the outside. My kids devoured their meals and said that was the best Mac n cheese and meatballs they'd ever eaten, and kids are Mac n cheese experts, so I believe them. Always always order a side of tater tots. Best tots ever. They are super crispy but not greasy. I'm so glad we have an Emporio in the suburbs.

Not sure what happened but I walked away feeling dejected. I sent a private message via Facebook to Pink Box and got a reply a few hours later. They apologized no one was available when I came by and offered a free donut which was really nice of them. I tried again a couple days later and this time I was able to get in. I told them it was my first time visiting and they took a moment to walk me through their doughnut selection. I wound up getting a half dozen of their gourmet doughnuts. The Nutty Pig and Cronuts are my favorites there. It's a small place just big enough to handle a few people in line. However, there are tables just outside in front where you can sit and eat. They only have regular coffee and hot chocolate available for hot drinks; milk and juice for the cold drinks. Although there are a couple more donut shops for me to check out here in Vegas, this one is my favorite, for now."

On a friday evening (holiday) ~6pm, there was about a 15 minute wait for 2 people. When we were ordering, the waiters told us that we weren't allowed to order a large pot to share, which wasn't the case at the Markham location. I'm guessing that's it's due to the layout of the conductors on the table which pre-determined that we could only order individual pots. The Markham location had more of an open-concept, so there was more flexibility in choosing whether we can share or have individual hot-pots. I wish they'd inform us before sitting down about this, though. Soup base: I've tried sweet corn, pork bone, tomato, and the spicy soup bases, but my absolute favourite is the mushroom. Even though I load up the sauces, I barely have to use it because there's so much tasty flavour that the food absorbs from the broth. Service: The service here is phenomenal. The waiter responded right away when he noticed that I was looking at the menu or that the table was clear and would ask us whether we'd like to order more dishes. At one point, I wanted more green onions from the self-serve sauce station, but it was empty, and told the waiter about it. He went beyond just notifying us that it was refilled, but brought a bowl of it to our table. Food: The deep fried milk buns are so good, especially when they refill it fresh from the kitchen. The beef and lamb are thinly sliced, and always taste fresh. Cheesy beef balls, hand pulled noodles, and crystal yam noodles are really good too. The soft serve is a great way to end the meal and also included. I like vanilla and chocolate, but not so much the matcha, which appears more brown than green. Whenever I go to Moral's Village, I always have a great experience but I only go once in awhile because it can get quite pricey at ~$40/person **They only take debit/cash, NO credit"

The spot is perfect for lunch if you work in the Ballantyne area, and a great place to go on a date. The interior reminds me somewhat of a upscale restaurant in the 60's.

He was an even better salesman. Just about every item he recommended we ordered. My girl and her sister had some mixed drinks. I kept it grown with a Negra Modelo beer. I ordered the New Mexico rubbed Pork Tenderloin sandwich. It comes with an order of fresh cut seasoned fries. Your dipping sauce is a spicy ketchup sauce. Outfreakingstanding! Our service was exactly what I expected. High level and professional. The bill damage wasn't that bad four a party of four. We will be back. Forgot to mention. My girl's sister had the duck. It was perfection in your mouth!!!"

They offer specials during their brunch on Saturday & Sunday from 11 AM - 3 PM. The arancini were so good we ordered them again! LIttle balls of risotto, marscapone, and mushrooms served with a white truffle aioli...mmmmm.... We also tried the bbq pork sliders, very good as well, American fries, and the heirloom tomato salad. The salad was another hit! Fresh burrata, arugala pesto and a sweet, rich balsamic. Very refreshing. The fries were a really nice surprise! They are served in a cone and seasoned with shallots and herbs, and then served with two sauces: a sherry aioli & a spice ketchup. Yowza! And the drinks, you might ask? That's why I've been wanting to try this place. I started with a pear winetini, a refreshing, slightly sweet (not cloying sweet) mix of prosecco, pear vodka, and st. germaine. I also tried a flight of red wines from Italy - very nice assortment. They have Happy Hour specials as well, so I'm thinking there's more arancini & wine in my future."

You truly can taste the care and craft in their brews! I also appreciate that though they have several locations, each one is unique unto itself, and not carbon-copies of each other. The food is also delicious, offering both tasty pub fare as well as more ethnicly styled dishes. I would recommend the fish tacos, and anything German-inspired they have to offer!

They handed me keys to a Chevy Impala, not what I expected, but whatever. It was nice and clean on the inside. It was a very long car. I was given a piece of paper to mark any noticeable damage on the car. After that I drove off. The whole process probably took less than 10 minutes. I came back, and they checked the car. They discounted my price down to $66 for some reason, maybe that I was 30 minutes early? Returning the car was painless and it too less than 2 minutes. Workers were nicer than most people described.

I've never tried it before or 2. because I wont have the chance elsewhere and well this was the case for In-n-out last week in Vegas. We had eaten breakfast at Egg and I that morning and I had stuffed my face with pancakes, bacon, and eggs so I was planning on a light dinner. I spent the rest of the morning driving around and buying foodie goodies at random places I had bookmarked (Popped and Bouchon Bakery) So there had been close to NO exercise being done. When I got back to the hotel one of the first things my sister suggested we do is go to in-n-out....She had just woken up from a 4 hour nap and she wants fast food? I was close to saying Sorry, no. But wait it's your 2nd to last day and you already decided your bringing Earls on the plane you won't have another chance said a devil voice in my head. Okay I said, let's go. As we walked into In-N-Out I was instantly transported back in time. The decor, the uniforms, the basic menu were all so 50's. I was a little surprised to see how simple the menu was but better for me, less decisions to make. Although I probably would have just stuck to fries at any other fast food place else my inner devil foodie demanded I try a burger so I went with the combo 1, a cheeseburger and fries. My sister ordered before and got the infamous animal fries which I thought were only lathered with their special sauce...WRONG. They had melted cheese, the special sauce and grilled onions. Heartattack on the spot. :-) Honestly I wish I had gone a little hungrier because although I was able to eat half my burger and 1/4 of the fries I didn't get to enjoy it as much as I may have after a night of drinking or on an empty stomach....Regardless, it was fresh fresh fresh for fast food and I was happy to see a guy making the fries from potatoes in the back.. I think next time I'll stick to an animal burger and regular fries.. I also have never seen such hard workers at a fast food joint, which definitely earns a star in my book! YELP 365: 162/365"

When I read Tony Hsieh's book \"Delivering Happiness\" and I saw the word culture so much, it gave me d\u00e9ja vu all over again. (Thanks Yogi) After my tour of Zappos today, I get it and how it works for this company. You sign up online for the tour. Parking is in the Zappos' garage off Las Vegas Boulevard before Stewart. You go to the second floor, sign in with the person in the lobby, and wait for your tour. You're given an ID badge and a name tag. Several culture reps divide the group and take you to see Zappos at work. My culture person was Ren\u00e9e and she was a gem! She was always happy to be asked a question and she had the answers for us. We saw some of the call center, the culture section where employees were dealing with customers either online or on the phone. We got to see the Z Caf\u00e9 and the employee patio. I am sure that the employees are not always smiling and not always happy, but I did see a whole bunch of people who seemed to be happily doing their jobs in a relaxed, informal setting and the idea of culture that Mr. Hsieh has been so focused on works! The tour lasts just about an hour. You are free to bring your camera and take photos. The only thing they ask is that you don't take photos of computer screens (it might have customer information on it or other things that should remain private) and they ask that there be no video. This is a tour that would be interesting for anyone to take. It's amazing to see what they did to the old Las Vegas City Hall."
